The goal of this project is to find new Bandcamp albums from the main discover section on Bandcamp homepage.

The discover section of Bandcamp is constantly updating with great albums, but they can be difficult to find because many of the albums have not garnered any attention, even after being published for years. A few comments on the album page is a good indicator that the album is worth listening to. I have found that filtering only these albums gives me a much more interesting selection of music to check out.

This tool scrapes the pages of Bandcamp's discover section, and saves each of the 8 albums on that page ONLY if there is a "more" dropdown button  on its comment's section, indicating that there are at least about 3 comments. Those album urls are opened as tabs in a new chrome window after the script finishes.

To use, click on a page or genre in the "discover" section and input that url into the GUI field along with a page range to search.

Requires a download of ChromeDriver.
